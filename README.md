# AI Chatbot for Document Question Answering

This repository holds the code for an experimental AI Chatbot designed to extract text from documents (specifically PDFs) and answer questions about the document. <br/><br/>

In this fullstack project, I am designing a model that converts document text to strings for LLM-powered Q&Aing. </br> 
Methods for question answering and text vectorization have been provided <br/> 
To use, initialize a `document_model` object in the main class, and implementation is self-explanatory so please refer to method args and return types. 

### Progress:

Frontend ❌ | Backend ✅ | AI Integration ✅ | PDF Parsing ✅ | Vector Database w/ API ❌
